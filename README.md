### Space Pirates

So you are telling you have no idea how to run this game, is that right? Ok, I got you.

Go to cmd and type

```python3 -m venv env```

then

```source\bin\activate```

then

```git clone https://github.com/dhrm1k/space-pirates.git```

and then

```pip install requirements.txt```

and then the very last

```python3 main.py```
